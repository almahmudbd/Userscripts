## What this repo is
- A collection of JavaScript userscripts authored or modified by almahmudbd.
- Scripts aim to be small, focused, and easy to install with any common userscript manager.
- Language composition: JavaScript.

## Installation (userscript managers)
1. Install a userscript manager in your browser:
   - Tampermonkey (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
   - Greasemonkey (Firefox)
   - Violentmonkey (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. Install a script by opening its raw .user.js file URL (from GitHub or Greasy Fork) in your browser. The userscript manager should detect the script and offer to install it.
3. Enable or configure the script from the userscript manager dashboard.

## Installing from this repository
- To install directly from GitHub:
  1. Navigate to the script file in this repo (path ends with .user.js).
  2. Click "Raw" to view the raw file contents.
  3. With a userscript manager installed, open the raw URL — the manager will prompt to install.
- Note: GitHub raw URLs use the branch name or a specific commit reference; installing from a branch will update when you reinstall or when userscript manager supports auto-updates from the raw URL.

## Installing from Greasy Fork
- Published scripts may be available on Greasy Fork (preferred for automatic updates and versioning).
- Visit the maintainer's Greasy Fork profile for published scripts and installation links:

- You can configure script settings (if provided) via the userscript manager's dashboard or the script’s menu commands.
- For site-specific issues or configuration, check the script header comments or the Greasy Fork script page for usage notes.
